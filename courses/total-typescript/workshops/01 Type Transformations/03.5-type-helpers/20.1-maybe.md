# Problem

```ts file:20.1-maybe.problem.ts
import { Equal, Expect } from "../helpers/type-utils";  
  
type Maybe = unknown;  
  
type tests = [  
  Expect<Equal<Maybe<string>, string | null | undefined>>,  
  Expect<Equal<Maybe<number>, number | null | undefined>>,  
  Expect<Equal<Maybe<boolean>, boolean | null | undefined>>,  
  Expect<Equal<Maybe<null>, null | undefined>>,  
];
```

# Solution

```ts file:20.1-maybe.solution.ts fold
import { Equal, Expect } from "../helpers/type-utils";  
  
type Maybe<T> = T | null | undefined;  
  
type tests = [  
  Expect<Equal<Maybe<string>, string | null | undefined>>,  
  Expect<Equal<Maybe<number>, number | null | undefined>>,  
  Expect<Equal<Maybe<boolean>, boolean | null | undefined>>,  
  Expect<Equal<Maybe<null>, null | undefined>>,  
];
```
